# Blocklist-Optimizer
The Blocklist Optimizer is a small coding project and handy tool for personal use. It lets you manage host lists by inputting IP addresses or loading them from a text file. The app splits long lists into smaller groups and saves them as separate text files, making it easy to organize blocklists on devices with alias limitations.
